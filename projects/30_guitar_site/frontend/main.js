Here's the main.js file for the Vue.js application for the Guitar Site project:

```javascript
import Vue from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
import router from './router'
import store from './store'
import vuetify from './plugins/vuetify'
import axios from 'axios'

Vue.config.productionTip = false

// Configure Axios
axios.defaults.baseURL = '/api'

new Vue({
  router,
  store,
  vuetify,
  render: h => h(App)
}).$mount('#app')
```

This main.js file sets up the Vue.js application, including the router, Vuex store, and Vuetify UI library. It also configures Axios to use the API base URL.

The main components and their interactions are as follows:

1. **App.vue**: The root component that renders the main layout, including the header, footer, and main content area.

2. **router/index.js**: Defines the application routes, such as the homepage, user profiles, guitar post details, and exploration pages.

3. **store/index.js**: Manages the application state, including user authentication, guitar posts, comments, likes, and shares.

   - **CommentSection.vue**: Handles the display and submission of comments on a guitar post.
