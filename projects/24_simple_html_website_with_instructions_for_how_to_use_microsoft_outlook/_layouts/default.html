Explanation:

1. **HTML5 structure**: The layout includes the basic HTML5 structure with `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements.
2. **Responsive meta tags**: The `<meta name="viewport">` tag is included to ensure the website is responsive and adapts to different device sizes.
3. **Navigation**: The navigation is defined as an unordered list (`<ul>`) with links to the following pages: Home, Outlook Setup, Sending Email, Email Security, Vacation Autoresponders, and Email Signatures.
4. **Content area**: The `{{ content }}` placeholder is included to render the content of each individual page.
5. **Footer**: The footer includes a copyright notice with the current year.
6. **JavaScript**: A link to a JavaScript file (`/assets/js/script.js`) is included at the end of the body for any additional functionality.

This default layout provides a basic structure for the Outlook instructional website, including a responsive design, navigation, content area, and footer. You can further customize the CSS (`/assets/css/styles.css`) and JavaScript (`/assets/js/script.js`) files to match the specific design and functionality requirements of the project.
